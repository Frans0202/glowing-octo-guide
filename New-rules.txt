1. don't pick up the phone, you know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone;
2. don't let him in, you'll have to kick him out again;
3. don't be his friend, you know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning;
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em.
